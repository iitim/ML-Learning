# ML Learning

This project is developed in order to learn the general ML models.


## Outline

- [Dataset](#dataset)
- [Models](#models)
  - [K-Means Clustering](#k-means-clustering)


## Dataset

Each model uses different datasets for the first development. Once they are ready for comparison, the common dataset used for them is [Celeb-DF-v1](https://github.com/yuezunli/celeb-deepfakeforensics/tree/master/Celeb-DF-v1). 

After loading, please use the script `util/video_handler.py` to pre-process the videos


## Models
### K-Means Clustering

Scripts and specific dataset is in `k_means_clustering/`
